Move ONE GmbH
###################

Move One GmbH is a car dealer, which sells cars in different locations. They
have several dealerships throughout Germany including two in Berlin, one in
Stuttgart and one more in Cologne. The cars are parked at any one dealership or
at a car park in Leipzig. They can be distributed to any of the locations on a
customers' request. The Move One GmbH sells different car brands and are
required to keep record of transactions and changes. Recently the Move One GmbH
had a lot of trouble keeping track of all the information. To manage their cars,
the cars' current location, sales, logistics and upcoming services, Move One
GmbH requires a customer relations management (CRM) software. Your task would be
to come up with a CRM + inventory management software concept tailored for car
dealers with multiple branches. Remember KISS and take care when defining
multiplicities.

****************

- UML-Class-Diagram
- UML-Sequence-Diagram

  - Add car to inventory

Optional

If you would optionally like to extend the design, here is a list of diagrams
you can draw up if you're feeling funny. This would probably require a more
detailed and thoroughly engineered concept.

- Behavioral UML Diagram

  - Activity diagram
  - Use case diagram
  - Interaction overview diagram
  - State machine diagram
  - Communication diagram
  - Sequence diagram

- Structural diagram

  - Class diagram
  - Object diagram (nice to have, requires certain state of dataset)
  - Component diagram (nice to have)
  - Composite structure diagram

Please share your solution via a public repository on GitHub or a ZIP file via
email. Diagrams can be designed in any tool of your liking, but please export
them to ``.pdf`` or ``.png``. All details must be recognizable.
